1. Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection Using YOLO and Computer Vision
This project focuses on enhancing soldier safety and situational awareness in military operations through real-time object detection using the YOLO algorithm and computer vision. It addresses the critical need for quick identification of threats—such as weapons, enemy combatants, and unauthorized vehicles—while accurately distinguishing them from civilians and friendly forces. By processing images and videos from conflict zones, the system automatically classifies objects like soldiers, vehicles, and trenches, providing real-time alerts to minimize risk and improve decision-making. With a Streamlit-based web application, the solution is accessible, user-friendly, and adaptable to diverse environments such as urban warfare, deserts, and forests. The project demonstrates robust performance with high precision and recall, offering significant implications for military surveillance, border security, and disaster response.

2. Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Computer Vision
This project aims to automate brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans using OpenCV and machine learning, addressing the limitations of manual segmentation which is time-consuming and prone to errors. By leveraging image processing and segmentation techniques, the system accurately identifies tumor boundaries, assisting radiologists in diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. The approach includes preprocessing MRI data, applying edge detection and morphological operations, and optionally training models like U-Net for more refined segmentation. The integrated Streamlit app allows users to upload scans and visualize segmented results, making the tool accessible in clinical and remote settings. With a focus on healthcare automation, this project supports telemedicine, enhances diagnostic precision, and contributes to global health equity by providing scalable and efficient diagnostic tools.

3. Number Plate Detection of Vehicles
This project presents a real-time vehicle number plate detection system utilizing YOLO and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to streamline traffic monitoring and law enforcement. The solution automates the detection and reading of license plates from images and video feeds, improving accuracy and efficiency in applications such as toll collection, parking management, and security surveillance. Through robust preprocessing, data augmentation, and real-time inference, the system handles diverse lighting conditions, occlusions, and plate styles. Integrated into a Streamlit web app, it offers an intuitive interface for uploading images or using webcam feeds, displaying both detected plates and extracted alphanumeric text. The model achieves high detection and OCR accuracy, demonstrating reliability in various environments, making it a powerful tool for smart city applications and intelligent transportation systems.
